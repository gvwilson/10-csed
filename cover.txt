To whom it may concern,

We wish to submit this paper to the "quick tips" section of the PLOS Computational Biology Education Collection.  It was originally submitted to the "Ten Simple Rules" collection as PCOMPBIOL-D-17-01221, and Dr. Francis Ouellette recommended the change.  We look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Dr. Neil C.C. Brown
Dr. Greg Wilson
