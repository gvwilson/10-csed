To whom it may concern,

Please find attached our revisions to our paper.  We have included
comments to the reviewers below, and look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Dr. Neil C.C. Brown
Dr. Greg Wilson

Reviewer #1

- Paragraph added to introduction to clarify intended audience.

- We agree that "the more coding, the better", but the research that
  we reference shows that the suggestions we make for including other
  teaching activities are well-founded for beginning programmers as
  well as those who are more experienced.  In particular, Porter et al
  (2011) is strong evidence for the benefits of peer instruction for
  novice programmers.

- The wording of the first tip has been changed to make it imperative
  for consistency with the others.

- We have added a paragraph to explain that live coding doesn't always
  have to start with a blank page (or screen).

- The reviewer is correct: the study by Bouvier et al (2016) showed
  that providing context is not necessarily helpful.

Reviewer #2

- The first paragraph of Rule 4 (Have students make predictions)
  connects live coding to having students make predictions. We agree
  that directing students' attention to particular aspects of the
  process would probably improve outcomes, but to our knowledge, no
  one has (yet) done this study for computing education.

- We have added a short version of all the recommendations in a box
  for reference as suggested.

Reviewer #3

- We have removed the evidence weightings as the reviewer suggested.
  (We agree upon reflection that they are probably more of a
  distraction than a help.)

- We now reference spreadsheets instead of PHP - our thanks for the
  suggestion.
